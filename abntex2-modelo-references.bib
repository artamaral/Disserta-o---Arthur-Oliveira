abstract="We present ProbLog2, the state of the art implementation of the probabilistic programming language ProbLog. The ProbLog language allows the user to intuitively build programs that do not only encode complex interactions between a large sets of heterogenous components but also the inherent uncertainties that are present in real-life situations. The system provides efficient algorithms for querying such models as well as for learning their parameters from data. It is available as an online tool on the web and for download. The offline version offers both command line access to inference and learning and a Python library for building statistical relational learning applications from the system's components.",

abstract="We describe the challenge of combining continuous computer vision techniques and qualitative, symbolic methods to achieve a system capable of cognitive vision. Key to a truly cognitive system, is the ability to learn: to be able to build and use models constructed autonomously from sensory input. In this paper we overview a number of steps we have taken along the route to the construction of such a system, and discuss some remaining challenges.",
